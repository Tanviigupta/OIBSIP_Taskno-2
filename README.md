PORTFOLIO

This is Task2 of my Web Development and Designing internship at Oasis Infobyte that is creating a my Portfolio website. This portfolio webpage is built using HTML and Css code. The HTML code used to create the portfolio webpage is simple and easy to understand, making it accessible to beginners who may not have experience with web development. With a little bit of customization, you can make the portfolio webpage your own and tailor it to the unique needs of your business.
